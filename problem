torch installed to slow using local machine.
even using uv still slow
use sudo for system wide installations
even sudo pip not allowed need to install system wide using apt
but uv could not use sudo
ady install python3-torch but could not import torch
oh apparently there is conflict where i ady installed torch in venv using uv and then i install using apt, the python session tried to import from uv but then have something that holds it back, when i exit venv and install back python3-torch i can import torch, but could import torchvision and torchaudio
what the hell is difference between import torch and import pytorch
plus why apt install much faster and library much smaller in size
apt install python3-tochvision and python3-torchaudio has no installtion candidaites


i thought this only applies to hugging face spaces but even to my kali linux machine

>>> import torch
/home/lancer/Downloads/Projects/Test-Torch/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/torch/_subclasses/functional_tensor.py:275: UserWarning: Failed to initialize NumPy: No module named 'numpy' (Triggered internally at /pytorch/torch/csrc/utils/tensor_numpy.cpp:81.)
  cpu = _conversion_method_template(device=torch.device("cpu"))
>>> 


if torch needed numpy why can't just installed together like how scikit-learn install scipy?

my main goal is to run this code , and apparently i don't need torchvision and torchaudio to run it as suggested from qwen and torch documetnations
also i cant use python3-torch when i use venv like i mentioned before

```python
from transformers import pipeline

finction_categories = ["Fiction", "Nonfiction"]

pipe = pipeline("zero-shot-classification",
                model="facebook/bart-large-mnli",
                device="mps")
```
im no confuse. why can't i run this code in any virtual instance at all? 
huggingface spaces docker jupyterlab X
kagglehub  

can certainly 
-> pip install torch nicely and import transformers but i cant initialize pipeline 
whit this given output ref : https://www.kaggle.com/code/normannurcy/test-torch/edit  


had to test for virtual env or conda instal torch torchvison and torchaudio, and follow the guidelines and run the following codes
